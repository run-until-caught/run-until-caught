### Hi there 👋
- I’m currently working on a new software development methodology, <b> Run-Until-Caught Development</b> 
- It's toally a :black_joker: and also not entirely. 
- Run-Until-Caught-Development is all about moving ⚡ in large 🏛️🏛️🏛️🏛️🏛️🏛️ organizations where projects typicaly move 🐌
- and I'm definitely not :raccoon: :raccoon: :raccoon: in a :coat: at a conference with lots of :cheese:
